The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n\tThis is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n\tRefreshments will be served.
